"Note: The indicator reports facility-based releases only. This table accounts only for the releases to water reported in the National Pollutant Release Inventory based on the inventory reporting criteria for releases of mercury, lead and cadmium and their compounds. These amounts should not be interpreted as comprehensive totals of releases to water of these pollutants in Canada. In 2014, a significant spill at the Mount Polley mine in central British Columbia accounted for large releases of mercury, lead and cadmium to water.",,,
